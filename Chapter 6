TRY IT YOURSELF
6-1. Person: Use a dictionary to store information about a person you know. Store their first name, last name, age, and the city in which they live. You should have keys such as first_name, last_name, age, and city. Print each piece
of information stored in your dictionary.
Answer:
person = {
    'first_name': 'John',
    'last_name': 'Doe',
    'age': 30,
    'city': 'New York'
}

# Print each piece of information
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key.title()}: {value}")

6-2. Favorite Numbers: Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers. Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print each person’s name and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a few friends and get some actual data for your program.
Answer:
favorite_numbers = {
    'Alice': 7,
    'Bob': 42,
    'Charlie': 23,
    'Diana': 9,
    'Eve': 13
}

# Print each person's name and favorite number
for name, number in favorite_numbers.items():
    print(f"{name}'s favorite number is {number}.")

6-3. Glossary: A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.
• Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their meanings as values.
• Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning pair in your output.
Answer:
glossary = {
    'variable': 'A named storage for data.',
    'list': 'A collection of items in a particular order.',
    'dictionary': 'A collection of key-value pairs.',
    'loop': 'A way to repeatedly execute a block of code.',
    'function': 'A named set of instructions that can be called.'
}

# Print each word and its meaning
for word, meaning in glossary.items():
    print(f"{word.title()}: {meaning}")

6-4. Glossary 2: Now that you know how to loop through a dictionary, clean up the code from Exercise 6-3 by replacing your series of print() calls with a loop that runs through the dictionary’s keys and values. When you’re sure that your loop works, add five more Python terms to your glossary. When you run your program again, these new words and meanings should automatically be included in the output.
Answer:
# Adding five more terms to the glossary
glossary['tuple'] = 'An immutable ordered collection of elements.'
glossary['set'] = 'An unordered collection of unique elements.'
glossary['method'] = 'A function that is associated with an object.'
glossary['argument'] = 'A value passed to a function or method.'
glossary['module'] = 'A file containing Python definitions and statements.'

# Print each word and its meaning using a loop
for word, meaning in glossary.items():
    print(f"{word.title()}: {meaning}")

6-5. Rivers: Make a dictionary containing three major rivers and the country each river runs through. One key-value pair might be 'nile': 'egypt'.
• Use a loop to print a sentence about each river, such as The Nile runs through Egypt.
• Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary.
• Use a loop to print the name of each country included in the dictionary.
Answer:
rivers = {
    'nile': 'egypt',
    'amazon': 'brazil',
    'yangtze': 'china'
}

# Print a sentence about each river
for river, country in rivers.items():
    print(f"The {river.title()} runs through {country.title()}.")

# Print the name of each river
print("\nRivers:")
for river in rivers.keys():
    print(river.title())

# Print the name of each country
print("\nCountries:")
for country in rivers.values():
    print(country.title())

6-6. Polling: Use the code in favorite_languages.py.
• Make a list of people who should take the favorite languages poll. Include some names that are already in the dictionary and some that are not.
• Loop through the list of people who should take the poll. If they have already taken the poll, print a message thanking them for responding. If they have not yet taken the poll, print a message inviting them to take the poll.
Answer:
favorite_languages = {
    'Alice': 'Python',
    'Bob': 'JavaScript',
    'Charlie': 'C#'
}

people_to_poll = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Eve']

for person in people_to_poll:
    if person in favorite_languages:
        print(f"Thank you, {person}, for responding to the poll!")
    else:
        print(f"Hello, {person}! We invite you to take the poll.")

6-7. People: Start with the program you wrote for Exercise 6-1. Make two new dictionaries representing different people, and store all three dictionaries in a list called people. Loop through your list of people. As you loop through the list, print everything you know about each person.
Answer:
person1 = {'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Doe', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
person2 = {'first_name': 'Alice', 'last_name': 'Johnson', 'age': 25, 'city': 'San Francisco'}
person3 = {'first_name': 'Bob', 'last_name': 'Smith', 'age': 35, 'city': 'Los Angeles'}

people = [person1, person2, person3]

# Loop through the list of people
for person in people:
    print("\nPerson:")
    for key, value in person.items():
        print(f"{key.title()}: {value}")

6-8. Pets: Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a different pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the owner’s name. Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list and as you do, print everything you know about each pet.
Answer:
pet1 = {'kind': 'dog', 'owner': 'Alice'}
pet2 = {'kind': 'cat', 'owner': 'Bob'}
pet3 = {'kind': 'parrot', 'owner': 'Charlie'}

pets = [pet1, pet2, pet3]

# Loop through the list of pets
for pet in pets:
    print("\nPet:")
    for key, value in pet.items():
        print(f"{key.title()}: {value}")

6-9. Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each person’s name and their favorite places.
Answer:
favorite_places = {
    'Alice': ['Paris', 'New York', 'Tokyo'],
    'Bob': ['London', 'Sydney'],
    'Charlie': ['San Francisco', 'Rio de Janeiro']
}

# Loop through the dictionary
for person, places in favorite_places.items():
    print(f"\n{person}'s favorite places:")
    for place in places:
        print(f"- {place}")

6-10. Favorite Numbers: Modify your program from Exercise 6-2 so each person can have more than one favorite number. Then print each person’s name along with their favorite numbers.
Answer:
favorite_numbers = {
    'Alice': [7, 14, 21],
    'Bob': [42, 84],
    'Charlie': [23, 46]
}

# Loop through the dictionary
for person, numbers in favorite_numbers.items():
    print(f"\n{person}'s favorite numbers:")
    for number in numbers:
        print(f"- {number}")

6-11. Cities: Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as keys in your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact about that city. The keys for each city’s dictionary should be something like country, population, and fact. Print the name of each city and all of the information you have stored about it.
Answer:
cities = {
    'New York': {'country': 'USA', 'population': 8398748, 'fact': 'Home of the Statue of Liberty'},
    'Tokyo': {'country': 'Japan', 'population': 13929286, 'fact': 'Hosted the 2020 Summer Olympics'},
    'Paris': {'country': 'France', 'population': 2140526, 'fact': 'Known as the City of Love'}
}

# Loop through the dictionary
for city, info in cities.items():
    print(f"\n{city}:")
    for key, value in info.items():
        print(f"{key.title()}: {value}")

6-12. Extensions: We’re now working with examples that are complex enough that they can be extended in any number of ways. Use one of the example programs from this chapter, and extend it by adding new keys and values, changing the context of the program, or improving the formatting of the output.
Answer:
Add more details to the People program or include additional information in the Favorite Places dictionary. The goal is to practice expanding and modifying existing code.
