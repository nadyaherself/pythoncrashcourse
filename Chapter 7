7-1. Rental Car: Write a program that asks the user what kind of rental car they would like. Print a message about that car, such as “Let me see if I can find you a Subaru.”
Answer:
car_type = input("What kind of rental car would you like? ")
print(f"Let me see if I can find you a {car_type.title()}.")

7-2. Restaurant Seating: Write a program that asks the user how many people are in their dinner group. If the answer is more than eight, print a message saying they’ll have to wait for a table. Otherwise, report that their table is ready.
Answer:
num_people = int(input("How many people are in your dinner group? "))

if num_people > 8:
    print("Sorry, you'll have to wait for a table.")
else:
    print("Your table is ready.")

7-3. Multiples of Ten: Ask the user for a number, and then report whether the number is a multiple of 10 or not.
Answer:
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number % 10 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is a multiple of 10.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not a multiple of 10.")

7-4. Pizza Toppings: Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of pizza toppings until they enter a 'quit' value. As they enter each topping, print a message saying you’ll add that topping to their pizza.
Answer:
topping = ""
while topping.lower() != 'quit':
    topping = input("Enter a pizza topping (enter 'quit' to finish): ")
    if topping.lower() != 'quit':
        print(f"Adding {topping} to your pizza.")

7-5. Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person’s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.
Answer:
while True:
    age = input("Enter your age (enter 'quit' to finish): ")
    if age.lower() == 'quit':
        break

    age = int(age)
    if age < 3:
        print("Your ticket is free.")
    elif 3 <= age <= 12:
        print("Your ticket is $10.")
    else:
        print("Your ticket is $15.")



7-6. Three Exits: Write different versions of either Exercise 7-4 or 7-5 that do each of the following at least once:
• Use a conditional test in the while statement to stop the loop.
• Use an active variable to control how long the loop runs.
• Use a break statement to exit the loop when the user enters a 'quit' value.
Answer:
# Using a conditional test
topping = ""
while topping.lower() != 'quit':
    topping = input("Enter a pizza topping (enter 'quit' to finish): ")
    if topping.lower() != 'quit':
        print(f"Adding {topping} to your pizza.")

# Using an active variable
active = True
while active:
    age = input("Enter your age (enter 'quit' to finish): ")
    if age.lower() == 'quit':
        active = False
    else:
        age = int(age)
        if age < 3:
            print("Your ticket is free.")
        elif 3 <= age <= 12:
            print("Your ticket is $10.")
        else:
            print("Your ticket is $15.")

# Using a break statement
while True:
    age = input("Enter your age (enter 'quit' to finish): ")
    if age.lower() == 'quit':
        break

    age = int(age)
    if age < 3:
        print("Your ticket is free.")
    elif 3 <= age <= 12:
        print("Your ticket is $10.")
    else:
        print("Your ticket is $15.")


7-7. Infinity: Write a loop that never ends, and run it. (To end the loop, press CTRL-C or close the window displaying the output.)
Answer:
while True:
    print("This loop will run indefinitely. Press CTRL-C to exit.")
